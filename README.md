# react-chm
Calendar heat map component based on React and d3js.

Inspired by [the original calendar heatmap](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318) created by [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/).

This version uses exclusively React for DOM manipulation. From the awesome D3 only the "time" and "scale" libraries are used.

Currently the CalendarHeatMap component does not really have support for customization which is work in progress.
If anyone is interested in using it and needs a certain feature, please ask me about it to prioritize.
